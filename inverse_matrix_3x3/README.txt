This repository contains a python file that finds a solution for the linear equation of an invertible 3x3 matrix composed with a column vector of 3 rows, then uses NumPy to compute the inverse of the matrix and uses that inverse to check that its composition with the previously computed solution gives us the column vector of 3 rows in return. The initial matrix is constructed using a class called Vec, which uses dictionaries and sets to define coordinates of the row vectors used in constructing this matrix.
