These scripts were built purely with the intentions of marrying two languages that work towards the same goal. The bash script is taking user input and storing it into a local csv file, while python is pulling the data from that csv file for analysis. I imagine this set of scripts could be useful for an athletic coach who may be interested in analyzing their team's strength stats. 

Clone this repository to your local machine, then run the python script in a bash editor.
