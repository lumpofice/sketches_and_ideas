This function uses a csv file, bearing temperatures and dates
at which those temperatures were recorded, to plot maximum and minimum
temperature values (by date) within the same visual. Once the file is
read, a header with column values and their associated indices will be
printed for the purposes of informing the user which data is desired for
plotting.
