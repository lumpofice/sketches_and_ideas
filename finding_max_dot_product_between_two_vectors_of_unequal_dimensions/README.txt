In this script, we are to find the maximum of a set of outputs computed by the dot product of two vectors of unequal dimensions. Specifically, in this example, one vector, v, is 6x1, while the other, u, is 9x1. If both coordinates in the product of coordinates are positive or if both are negative, the dot product will contribute a positive value to its sum. If one coordinate is negative and one positive in the product of coordinates, then the dot product will contribute a negative value to its sum. Iterating over each index between 0 and the difference in rows between these two vectors, which is 3 in this example, we take the maximum of the dot products computed at each.
